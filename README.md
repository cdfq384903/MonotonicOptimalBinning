# MonotonicOptimalBinning
This project mainly implements the Monotonic Optimal Bining algorithm. We extend the application of this algorithm which can be applied to numerical and categorical data. In order to avoid the problem of too many bins, we optimize the p-value and provide bins size first binning and monotonicity first binning methods for users discretize data conveniently.
